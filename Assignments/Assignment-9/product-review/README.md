## How I created this Website & What is the purpose?

* This website is created using react. Here I have created home page, reviews, dashboards, blogs and footer pages. Header and footer page is common for all pages.

* To the home page I designed simply as car selling website. In home page there shows 3 customer reviews and if user click on see all reviews then user can see all reviews.
* Review page contain all reviews and In the dashboard section there are some charts shown according to data. and I added some question in the blog page. About page contain simple about us information.
* I used Custom Hooks for load data form different place and Custom active link in the navbar and I created my own json file for load and use data from there.
